You are attempting to run Meteor as the 'root' superuser. If you are
developing, this is almost certainly *not* what you want to do and will likely
result in incorrect file permissions. However, if you are running this command
in a build process (CI, etc.), or you are absolutely sure you know what you are
doing, set the METEOR_ALLOW_SUPERUSER environment variable or pass
--allow-superuser to proceed.

Even with METEOR_ALLOW_SUPERUSER or --allow-superuser, permissions in your app
directory will be incorrect if you ever attempt to perform any Meteor tasks as
a normal user. If you need to fix your permissions, run the following command
from the root of your project:

  sudo chown -Rh <username> .meteor/local
